## Product Request System Improvements

### Priority 1 (Critical)
- [x] Fix schema issues: Rename `audit logs` table to `audit_logs` (remove space)
- [ ] Add database indexes for frequently queried columns (user_id, branch_id, status, created_at)
- [ ] Add inventory transfer logic when requests are approved (move products between branches)
- [ ] Add stock validation to prevent over-requesting (check available quantity before approval)
- [ ] Add proper constraints for status values (pending, approved, denied)

### Priority 2 (Important)
- [ ] Add bulk approve/deny functionality for multiple requests
- [ ] Add request expiration system (auto-expire old pending requests)
- [ ] Improve error handling and input validation
- [ ] Add low stock alerts when products are running low
- [ ] Add request priorities (urgent, normal, low)

### Priority 3 (Nice to have)
- [ ] Add request analytics and reporting (popular products, request patterns)
- [ ] Add export functionality for request data (Excel/CSV)
- [ ] Add real-time notifications for request updates
- [ ] Add request templates for common request patterns
- [ ] Add request comments/threads for better communication
- [ ] Add performance metrics (approval times, success rates)
- [ ] Add request history search functionality
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Add pagination for large datasets

## Non-Functional Pages & Mock Data (Keep for now, remove later)

### Pages with Mock Data (Still Present but Not Functional)
- [ ] **AuditLogsPage.tsx** - Uses mock audit log data, needs real API integration
- [ ] **Sales.tsx** - Uses mock sales data and charts, needs real sales API
- [ ] **Transffered.tsx** - Uses mock transferred products data, needs real transfer API
- [ ] **Request_product.tsx** - Uses static product data, needs dynamic product loading
- [ ] **ProductTable.tsx** - Has mock export functionality, needs real export API

### Mock Data to Remove Later
- [ ] **AuditLogsPage.tsx** - Remove mockLogs array (lines 66-191), replace with real API call
- [ ] **Sales.tsx** - Remove mock product data (lines 167-208), replace with real sales data
- [ ] **Transffered.tsx** - Remove mock products array (lines 22-86), replace with real transfer data
- [ ] **Request_product.tsx** - Remove static initialProduct (lines 23-33), make dynamic
- [ ] **ProductTable.tsx** - Remove mockExport function (lines 198-203), implement real export
- [ ] **All_Stock.tsx** - Remove handleImportExcel stub (lines 285-287), implement real import
- [ ] **UnifiedProductRequest.tsx** - Remove mockExport function (lines 275-278), implement real export

### Non-Functional Features (Keep UI, implement later)
- [ ] **Export to Excel** - Multiple components have mock export buttons
- [ ] **Import Excel** - All_Stock.tsx has import functionality stub
- [ ] **Real-time notifications** - No WebSocket or polling implementation
- [ ] **Sales analytics** - Sales.tsx has charts but no real data
- [ ] **Transfer tracking** - Transffered.tsx shows mock transfer data
